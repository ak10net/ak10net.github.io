# Summary notes from The Psychology of Money<!--more-->

1. **No one is crazy**. Decisions related to money are situational dependent on the economy, inflation, personal wealth,
risk. What might seem crazy to one might be normal to the other.

2. **Luck and Risk**. Luck and risk are siblings. Other than individual efforts they are part of every outcome.

3. **Never Enough**. Money and wealth are never enough. But it is enough to know your goal post and keep it 
from stop moving

4. **Compounding**. Most returns multiply late with compounding. Compounding is a long
term game with a fat tail.

5. **Getting wealthy and staying wealthy**. Getting wealthy is much discussed but not staying wealthy. 
No one talks about not screwing up, frugality and paranoia.

6. **Tails you win**. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. Loose small and make big.
Long-tail events bring the most fortune, stay long in the game to reap the benefits.

7. **Freedom**. Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays. Happiness is subjective but
having a strong sense of control of oneâ€™s life is a dependable predictor of positive feelings.

8. **Man in the car paradox**. No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are. People
see objects and ignore people. Don't think possessions bring you anything.

9. **Wealth is what you don't see**. Spending money to show people how much money you have is 
the fastest way to lose money. So, save money.

10. **Save money**. Exercise control on spending and investing. Saving is the wealth that you don't see.

11. **Reasonable is better than rational**. Be reasonable before being rational. Reasonable is more realistic
and in the long run, you will stick with it.

12. **Surprise!**. Learn from history and calibrate expectations. Black swan events occur, be vigilant
and look out for outlier events that move the needle the most. The world is surprising and unpredictable.

13. **Room for error**. Plan on your plan not going according to the plan and plan for contingencies.

14. **You will change**. Long-term planning is hard. Goals change so do people. If something is not 
working and might not work in the future, leave it. Reduce the sunk cost and change goals sooner
you will get back to compounding. 

15. **Nothing is free**. Everything has a price. The key is to figure out what the price is and be willing
to pay it. Price is always not obvious until the bill is overdue.

16. **You and Me**. Beware of taking cues from people playing a different game than you are playing. 
People have different aims/games when listening to them and taking advice try to figure out
where are they coming from and what is their game. It might not be the one that you
are playing.

17. **The seduction of pessimism**. Optimism is like a sales pitch and pessimism is a cry for help.
Optimism has odds in favor over time with setbacks on the way. Pessimism has a general cynical
outlook on the future. Progress is slow but failures happen overnight. Don't let pessimism pull you
out of the game, keep skin in the game and play it. 

18. **When you will believe anything**. Why stories are more powerful than statistics. Humans tend
to overestimate the odds in favor and underestimate the risks. We complete an incomplete world view too
fill the gaps.

19. **All together now**.
Winning humility. Losing forgiveness. Luck and risk are real. Focus on things you can control.
Less ego, more wealth. Saving starts from today. Increase investing time horizon. Things go 
wrong okay with it. Long-tail guides the fortune. Use the money to gain control over time. Be nice 
and less flashy. Save for no reason. Nothing is free, be ready to pay the price and view that as to
fee rather than fines. Embrace room for error. Endurance makes compounding magic over time. Avoid
extreme ends of financial decisions. Take risk but be paranoid of ruinous risk because that 
will throw you out of the game. Define your game. Don't be influenced by people playing different
games. Respect the mess. There are no right answers. The world is full of surprises.
