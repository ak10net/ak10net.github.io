## In this post we will understand the art of data science.<!--more-->

## Data analysis is art
Data analysis is hard, few people can explain how to do it properly.
Good data analysis involves algorithms, data, processes, tools, and secret sauce
of creative thinking to get an acceptable and meaningful outcome.

### Epicycle of analysis
Data analysis is not linear, rather it is iterative or circular.
1. **Setting expectation**. Brainstorm about problem statements and scenarios.
2. **Collecting data**. Check all data needs to be collected to meet the expectation.
3. **Revise expectation**. If the expectation meets the data move on, if not collect more data and revise.

### Core activities
1. Stating and refining the question
2. Exploring the data
3. Building a formal statistical model
4. Interpreting the result
5. Communicating the result

For each of the steps repeat the epicycles of setting expectation to collecting data to revising expectation.

### Stating and refining the question
**Types of question**
1. Descriptive - Summary statistics
2. Exploratory - Analyze patterns, trends, and relations
3. Inferential - Answer hypothesis
4. Predictive - What predicts the outcome
5. Causal - Find of causality of an event
6. Mechanistic - How something happens

**Characteristics of a good question**
1. Should be interesting to the audience
2. Should not be already answered
3. Should have a  plausible framework 
4. Should be answerable from the data
5. Should be specific

After this step, convert question to data question.

### Exploratory data analysis
1. Formulate a question
2. Read data 
3. Check data and eyeball summary statistics
4. Count rows, columns, and unique values
5. Validate with an external source
6. Plot the univariate and bivariate plots


**Explore data with modeling**
1. Heuristic modeling
2. Try to guess the distribution of data
3. Simulate data and compare
4. Experiment

### Data modeling
1. Develop a specification of the  question and how data can be used to answer that question.
2. Build a primary model first and secondary model to beat the primary benchmark. Make model more robust.
3. Analyze associations of the  outcome, key features, and potential confounders.
4. Analyze prediction accuracy and measure prediction errors.


### Interpretation of results
1. Revisit the  original question.
2. Measure directionality, magnitude, and uncertainty of model.
3. Measure implications of the model.

### Communication of results
1. Routine communication of focused questions, feedback on results and exceptions.
2. Formal communication of broad question, implications in business terms.
